# Bi-dimensional Augmented Reduced Rank Regression (baRRR)

This folder contains R functions and a simple demostration of usage for the **bi-dimensional augmented reduced rank regression** (baRRR) method, which is an powerful extension for the **maRRR** method presented in the article:

Jiuzhou Wang and Eric F. Lock. [Multiple Augmented Reduced Rank Regression for Pan-Cancer Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16333.pdf), _Biometrics_, to appear, 2023.

The method can perform prediction, dimension reduction and missing data imputation for multi-view multi-cohort data.
